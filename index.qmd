**Title:** *Analysis and Visualization of Regional and Temporal Changes in Education Levels in Turkey*

**Description:**\
This project explores the trends and disparities in education levels across Turkish provinces and regions from 2008 to 2023. Using data from TÜİK, the study analyzes literacy rates, educational attainment, and gender differences over time. Key visualizations, including bar chart races and heatmaps, highlight regional variations and improvements in literacy rates, particularly in eastern provinces. The project also investigates the narrowing gender gap in education, emphasizing the impact of policies aimed at promoting equal access to education. Through this analysis, the study sheds light on patterns of progress and identifies areas requiring further attention to address educational inequalities in Turkey.
